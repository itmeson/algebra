1. Round 84,619 to the nearest hundreds place:

2. Evaluate $20 - 3(6-4)^2 + 5$

3. Calculate: Be sure the final answer is in lowest terms.

$ \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{1}{2} $

4. Fill in the chart below: Simplify all fractions.

   a. Convert $\\frac{3}{8}$ into a decimal
   b. Convert $0.04$ into a percent
   c. Convert $125\\%$ into a fraction

5. Simplify: $ 3 - 2x + 5 - 3(x-6) $

6. Solve:  $6 - 2x = 4x + 12$

7. The sum of three times a number and four is ten. Write the equation. Do not solve.

8. Solve the proportion:

$ \\frac{4}{n} = \\frac{6}{10}$

9. Multiple choice.  $300$ is $20\\%$ of what?

   a. 200
   b. 6667
   c. 1500
   d. 60

10. What is $\\$60$ increased by $25\\%$?

    a. $\\$75.00$
    b. $\\$15.00$
    c. $\\$45.00$
    d. $\\$84.00$

11. Write equation(s) for the following, but DO NOT SOLVE:

Alan, Betty and Carl pooled their money to buy a plasma TV. If Alan contributed \$60
more than Betty, Carl contributed twice as much as Betty, and a total of \$280 was raised,
how much did each contribute?”

12. Simplify the expression completely:
$$ \\frac{-(4x^3 y^3)^2 (y^0)}{2x^2y^8} $$


13. Solve by factoring:
$$ 2x^3 + 6x^2 −56x = 0 $$


14. Solve each equation for x:
    a. $2x + 5 = 10 $
    b. $-3x - 10 = 20$ 
    c. $3x + 5 = -2x + 15$
    d. $5x - 7 = 11x - 19 $

15.  Graph the following equations on the same axes:

    a. $3x + 4y = 50$
    b. $y = 10x - 50$ 


16. The sum of two numbers is -18.  
    One number is 2 greater than three times the other. 
    Turn both sentences into equations, then find the two numbers.  

17. Simplify the following expressions:

   a. $(\\frac{7}{9})^0$
   b. $y^{-2}y^{-5}$
   c. $(-xy^2)^{-4}$  
   d. $(y^3y^4)^4$
   e. $y^2y^5$


18. 

a. A runner starts running toward San Francisco from Providence (3050 miles away), going a steady 8 miles per hour. Make an equation that gives their distance *from Providence* at any given number of hours after they begin.  

b. Another runner starts running toward Providence from San Francisco, going a steady 10 miles per hour. Make an equation that gives their distance *from Providence* at any given number of hours after they begin.

c. Graph both equations on the same axes

d. Solve to determine how many miles *from Providence* they will be when they meet, and how many hours they will have been running.

 
19. Determine what values of x will make y equal to zero:

    a. $y = x^2 + 10x + 25$ 

    b. $y = x^2 - 3x - 70$

    c. $y = x^2 - 8x + 15$

    d. $y = 3x^3 -15x^2 - 42x$  

    e. $2y + 1.4x = 5x^2 - 6$



20.  BONUS

The mythical Hydra was a beast that was very difficult to kill -- if you cut
off its head, it grew 12 new ones to replace it.  If you cut off one of those
heads, 12 more would grow... and if you cut off one of those, 12 more would
grow... and so on.

The mythical Super-Hydra is even worse -- cutting off the one head causes 12
more to grow, but cutting off one of the new heads causes all of them to die!
For an instant... and then ALL 12 OF THEM SPROUT 12 NEW HEADS!

a. Write equations describing the number of heads each hydra has for any number of head cuttings -- for example, it would allow you to plug in "5" for the number of cuts, and the equation will tell you how many heads there are.

b. How many heads would you have to cut off before each Hydra gets to 1 BILLION
heads?
